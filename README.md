To run project in the browser run

### `yarn start`

Thanks for giving me the opportunity to complete this project, I really enjoyed it although had some issues towards the end.
As was mentioned in the brief, the estimated completion time was about 3-4 hours. I decided not to go over this suggested timeframe so as to not give an unrealistic idea of how quickly and efficiently I would be able to complete similar tasks.

Although the project isn't completed to 100% functionality, I hope this helps give you an accurate idea of my abilities and work rate. After solving an initial CORS issue and having access to products and Metadata, I was able to render all products, logo and sale prices. From here I made checks to see if the products were available or sold out. I have left a console.log function to show that the sort ascending/descending order works in the console via the sort highest/lowest price and handleChange function. Where I ran into some issues was in displaying those changes to the webpage. I was able to map through the products and change price, but not render those changes correctly for all products. I am happy to explain my logic, areas I think I did well and areas for improvement. 

I would love the opportunity to be able to work for Catch, continue my education and learn from more experienced developers; potentially in a more Junior - Mid level role. Software development is a never ending learning journey, with new framework, libraries and ideas becoming available so regularly. This is part of the reason I am so passionate about it and want to continue to grow within the industry.

I appreciate you taking the time to look through my project and would be happy to have a chat to answer any questions.
Thanks a lot,
Billy
